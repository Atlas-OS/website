# How to report issues

This guide explains how to report issues you find [when testing](/docs/contributing/testing/).

## AME Beta logs

Before reporting, we would find it useful if you could skim through your AME Beta logs (located in <CodeInline text="C:\ProgramData\AME\Logs" />) to look for the following:

- The <CodeInline text="Output.txt" /> from the latest Playbook
  - Check if there are any errors in the scripts
  - If there are any logical errors in the scripts
- The <CodeInline text="Log.yml" />
  - Check if there are any errors from AME Beta

If you find anything, include that in your report. However, **post all logs when reporting bugs so we can also look through them.** No personally identifiable information is contained in these, except from your Windows username.

## Where to report

### If it's the latest release...

Please report to the [Atlas GitHub Issues](https://github.com/Atlas-OS/Atlas/issues). Ensure that you follow the issue template.

### If it's from a GitHub branch...

Ideally, report to the <CodeInline text="📘 ┃ playbook" /> channel under our [Discord's 'Development' category](https://discord.com/invite/atlasos). Otherwise, report to the [Atlas GitHub Issues](https://github.com/Atlas-OS/Atlas/issues). Ensure that you follow the issue template.

### If it's a preview from our Discord...

Report to the designated <CodeInline text="🧪 ┃ issue-reporting" /> forum channel under the 'Development' category.
