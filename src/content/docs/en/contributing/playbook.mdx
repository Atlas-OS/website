# Contributing to the Atlas Playbook

This guide covers how to modify, test, and build Atlas. Before contributing, read the [Contribution Guidelines](/docs/contributing/).

## How the Playbook works

### What Playbooks are

AME Playbooks are bundles of regular scripts, executables, and other files alongside script-like AME [YAML](https://gettaurus.org/docs/YAMLTutorial/) files. These YAML files have commands called [actions](https://docs.ameliorated.io/developers/actions.html), which can do things like running executables or setting Registry entries.

[AME Beta](https://ameliorated.io/) is the easy-to-use GUI for users to run Playbooks, and it uses the open-source [TrustedUninstaller](https://github.com/Ameliorated-LLC/trusted-uninstaller-cli) as its backend.

To start adding to Atlas, we recommend browsing our repository's source code to get familiar with how we've structured Atlas.

### What Atlas uses internally

The Atlas Playbook primarily uses the following three languages:

1. [PowerShell scripting](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/scripting/learn/ps101/01-getting-started)
2. [Batch scripting](https://ss64.com/nt/syntax.html)
3. [YAML](https://gettaurus.org/docs/YAMLTutorial/) - Yet Another Markup Language

For development tools and resources, we recommend using:

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/learn)
  - The Atlas repo contains VSCode configs by default for building, syntax highlighting, and more
- [Microsoft documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/resources/)
- [AME documentation](https://docs.ameliorated.io/developers.html)
- Nirsoft utilities
  - [RegistryChangesView](https://www.nirsoft.net/utils/registry_changes_view.html)
  - [ServiWin](https://www.nirsoft.net/utils/serviwin.html)
- [Sysinternals](https://learn.microsoft.com/sysinternals/downloads/)

## How to build a Playbook

If you want to test existing builds, consider viewing our [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/Atlas-OS/Atlas/actions/workflows/apbx.yaml), which builds a Playbook for each commit. Otherwise, clone the <CodeInline text="Atlas-OS/Atlas" /> repo before continuing or using your fork.

### Using VSCode

1. Open [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/), and open the cloned Atlas repo as a folder
2. Install the [PowerShell](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.PowerShell) extension
   - Non-Windows users must [install PowerShell](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell) first
3. Install [7-Zip](https://7-zip.org/) or [NanaZip](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9n8g7tscl18r) if not done already
   - For [macOS](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/sevenzip)/[Linux](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/p7zip), install 7-Zip (official or <CodeInline text="p7zip" />) using a package manager
4. **Optional:** Install the other extensions recommended in the 'Extensions' tab
5. Use the 'Run and Debug' options to build a Playbook
   - See the <CodeInline text=".vscode" /> launch options to know what each option does
6. See your built Playbook in **src\playbook** in the repo

### Using the build script directly

1. Install [7-Zip](https://7-zip.org/) or [NanaZip](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9n8g7tscl18r) if not done already
   - For [macOS](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/sevenzip)/[Linux](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/p7zip), install 7-Zip (official or <CodeInline text="p7zip" />) using a package manager
2. For macOS/Linux, install [the latest PowerShell](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell)
3. Navigate to <CodeInline text="src\playbook" /> in the cloned Atlas repo
4. If on Windows, run <CodeInline text="build-playbook.cmd" />, else use <CodeInline text="build-playbook.sh" />

## How to run your built Playbooks

For testing, we primarily use virtual machines unless we are testing for a final release, in which case we test on real hardware.

This section will tell you how we set up virtual machines for testing.

### Virtualization software

We recommend:

- **[Hyper-V](https://learn.microsoft.com/virtualization/hyper-v-on-windows/quick-start/enable-hyper-v)** - Type-1 hypervisor (fastest), built into Windows
- **[VMWare Workstation](https://www.vmware.com/products/desktop-hypervisor.html)** - Type-2 hypervisor, good UI and features

### Snapshotting

Snapshotting is a feature in most virtual machine software that saves the current memory, disk, and settings of a virtual machine so that you can restore it later.

Snapshots are handy for Atlas as you can test one Playbook and revert to unmodified Windows to test another Playbook once finished. Additionally, you can save a snapshot for testing something specific and return to it later.

### Which snapshots to make

<Callout type="tip" title="Setup your snapshots ready for a Playbook">
  It's best to make your initial snapshots already set up with [AME
  Beta](https://download.ameliorated.io/AME%20Beta.zip) and some essential utilities (e.g.
  [Sysinternals](https://learn.microsoft.com/sysinternals/downloads/)) so that you can just
  drag-and-drop a Playbook as soon as you go to a snapshot.
</Callout>

We recommend making three initial snapshots:

- Stock Windows **without** Windows Updates installed
  - For testing installing Windows Updates after installing Atlas
  - To ensure updates don't install, [pause updates indefinitely](https://github.com/Atlas-OS/docs/blob/main/docs/assets/other/pause-updates.reg) before connecting to the internet. Un-pause them later in Windows Settings
- Stock Windows **with** Windows Updates installed
  - Consider updating Windows and remaking the snapshot every so often
- **Optional:** A current release Atlas snapshot if you need to test anything there
  - Helpful in diagnosing [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/Atlas-OS/Atlas/issues)

### That's it!

Any Atlas Playbook should be ready to get tested now. Ensure that you extensively test what you're working on.
