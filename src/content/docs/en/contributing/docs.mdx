# Contributing to documentation

This guide covers how to modify and preview the Atlas documentation locally. Before contributing, read the [Contribution Guidelines](/docs/contributing/).

This assumes you've already cloned the <CodeInline text="Atlas-OS/docs" /> repository.

## How the documentation is built

[Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) is used to build the Atlas docs, powered by the following:

- YAML configuration
- HTML, JavaScript, and CSS overrides
- Extended [Markdown](https://www.markdowntutorial.com/) for the pages

<Callout type="tip">
  We recommend viewing [their reference
  documentation](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/reference/).
</Callout>

## Prerequisites

As Material for MkDocs uses Python, you must install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/), including <CodeInline text="pip" />. Additionally, consider checking the VSCode extension recommendations.

## Viewing your changes live

The docs will refresh on any page change and reflect what you've just saved.

### Windows

1. Run <CodeInline text="locally-host.cmd" /> to host the documentation preview
   - This also installs and updates dependencies
2. Navigate to the URL it provides in the console

### Non-Windows

1. Run <CodeInline text="pip install -r local-requirements.txt" /> to install all the dependencies inside of the repository
   - You might need to use a virtual environment like <CodeInline text="pipenv" /> or distro-specific packages for dependencies
   - Consider checking the VSCode extension recommendations
2. Run <CodeInline text="mkdocs serve" /> to host the documentation preview
3. Navigate to the URL it provides in the console
