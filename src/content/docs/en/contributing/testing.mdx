# Testing guide

This guide covers recommended testing for alpha or release candidate builds. If you find problems, see [the reporting issues page](/docs/contributing/reporting/).

If you need to set up a virtual machine, see the [Playbook contributing page](/docs/contributing/playbook/) for instructions. You can also test on real hardware, especially for release candidates.

<Callout type="info" title="Test on Stock Windows First">
  To reduce the amount of false reports, please verify that any issues encountered on Atlas do not
  happen in the same environment and configuration on unmodified Windows.
</Callout>

## Your personally used Windows features

Testing the features you use is recommended, especially if it's different from a typical configuration or usage. Some examples of this include:

- Non-English languages
  - Multiple languages & keyboard layouts
- Touchscreen support
- ARM-based Windows (11 only)
- Accessibility features
- Hyper-V and WSL

## New user accounts

Try making then logging into new user accounts, and making sure that all tweaks apply.

## Your personally used apps/games

We recommend testing all software and games you use in a realistic environment to ensure that Atlas has not introduced incompatibilities.

Please ensure you install drivers properly beforehand and can't reproduce any encountered issues on stock Windows in the same environment.

## Windows Update

As Atlas supports Windows Update, consider testing the following that all make use of Windows Update's components:

- From the base ISO (no updates), installing all Windows Updates post-Atlas
- Language pack installation
- Various optional Windows features
- Store and XBOX game installation/updates

## Remoting and file sharing

Consider testing local network features such as:

- Windows file sharing
  - Enable with the [Atlas script](/docs/atlas-configuration/settings/) first
  - Ensure that it works on stock Windows
- Screencasting
- Remote Desktop

## Atlas folder

We recommend doing lots of testing in the Atlas folder. For this, we recommend the following:

- Testing each script and checking if it does its functionality
  - Especially the significant scripts like disabling Defender
  - If prompted for anything, test various inputs
  - Make sure to restart if prompted
- Suggesting where we can:
  - Improve the structure
  - Improve user experience
  - Simplify the folder
