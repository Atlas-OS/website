# Contribution guide

Thank you for your interest in contributing to AtlasOS! This guide will help you understand how to contribute effectively to our projects. We appreciate all contributions, big and small.

## Our contribution platform

Atlas uses [GitHub](https://github.com/Atlas-OS) to manage everything. Please note that our documentation does not contain instructions on how to use GitHub or Git; if you're unfamiliar with them, see the [GitHub quick-start guide](https://docs.github.com/get-started/quickstart) first.

A [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/Atlas-OS/.github/blob/main/profile/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) applies to each Atlas repository. Please read this before contributing.

## How to make changes

<Callout type="tip" title="Unsure if people will like your change?">
  Consider proposing the change in the [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/atlasos) or [GitHub
  issues](https://github.com/Atlas-OS/Atlas/issues) first. Remember that it's okay to make
  mistakes—people will provide feedback in your pull requests. Don't worry too much about getting
  everything perfect on the first try.
</Callout>

Follow these steps to contribute:

1. **Fork or branch** - Create a fork (external contributors) or branch (team members) in the repository
2. **Make your changes** - Implement your improvements or fixes
3. **Submit a pull request** - Create a PR to the primary branch of the repository
4. **Wait for reviews** - Wait for at least two reviews (depending on change size)
   - Team members only require one review
5. **Merge** - Once approved, your PR will be squash-merged (all commits combined into one)

<Callout type="info">
  Team members may skip pull requests for uncontroversial, well-tested changes that don't require
  review.
</Callout>

## Formatting

Before a pull request, ensure that:

- Your changes comply with the general formatting of a repository
- There's a minimal amount of mistakes; check grammar and anything else important
  - For YAML changes, verify that they are valid using a linter

## Commit signature verification

We highly recommend setting up [commit signature verification](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification). It marks your commits as **Verified**, indicating that someone else has not forged commits.

Check out this [detailed guide on setting up verified commits](https://gist.github.com/Beneboe/3183a8a9eb53439dbee07c90b344c77e#file-how-to-setup-verified-commits-md).

## Conventional commits

We recommend using [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) in Atlas repositories for consistency and more descriptive commits.

Conventional Commits is a commit message format that helps make the commit history more readable and easier to navigate.

_Example_: <CodeInline text="feat: ✨ add fAllowFullControl" />

[Extension for Visual Studio Code <Icon name="tabler:arrow-right" class="inline h-4 w-4 mx-1" />](https://github.com/vivaxy/vscode-conventional-commits)
