# Windows settings

The Windows Settings folder contains shortcuts to common Windows configuration pages. Some settings may require activating Windows first using the "Activation" file.

All configuration files listed here are located in the <CodeInline text="3. Configuration/3. Windows Settings" /> folder within the Atlas folder on your Desktop. If you can't find the Atlas folder, see [our guide to restore it](/docs/faq/post-install/).

Running these files opens the corresponding Windows Settings page directly.

## Activation

This file opens the Windows Activation settings page. You may need to activate Windows before changing some other settings.

AtlasOS requires a valid Windows license. Activate Windows with a legitimate license before installation. Activation is a one-time process.

<Callout type="warning" title="Atlas is Not Pre-activated">
  AtlasOS is **not** a pre-activated version of Windows. You must activate Windows with a valid,
  legitimate license before installation. When purchasing a Windows license, ensure the seller is
  trusted and the license is legitimate.
