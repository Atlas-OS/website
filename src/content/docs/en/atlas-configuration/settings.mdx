# Basic settings

Configure essential Windows features and system options to match your needs. These settings control core functionality like Bluetooth, Game Mode, notifications, and more.

All configuration files listed here are located in the **3. Configuration** folder within the Atlas folder on your Desktop. If you can't find the Atlas folder, see [our guide to restore it](/docs/faq/post-install/).

<Callout type="info">
  Most settings require a system restart to take effect. We'll remind you when needed.
</Callout>

## Before you start

These settings give you control over Windows features that AtlasOS modifies by default. Before making changes:

- Understand what each feature does and why you might want to enable or disable it
- Make sure you have a reason to change the default settings
- Remember that AtlasOS defaults are optimized for performance and responsiveness

For more configuration options, check:

- [Advanced Configuration](/docs/atlas-configuration/advanced/) - Advanced system options
- [Optional Tweaks](/docs/atlas-configuration/tweaks/) - Interface personalization
- [Windows Settings](/docs/atlas-configuration/windows/) - Quick shortcuts to Windows configuration

## Background apps

**When to use:** Enable if you need apps to run in the background (e.g., Sea of Thieves requires this).

By default, AtlasOS disables background apps to improve system responsiveness and reduce resource usage. Some games and applications require background apps to function properly.

To enable background apps, run <CodeInline text="Enable Background Apps.reg" /> in the **Background Apps** folder and restart your system.

## Bluetooth

**When to use:** Enable if you need to connect Bluetooth devices like headphones, speakers, or game controllers.

Bluetooth is disabled by default in AtlasOS to reduce system overhead. If you use Bluetooth devices, you'll need to enable this feature.

1. Run the <CodeInline text="Enable Bluetooth.cmd" /> file in the **Bluetooth** folder
2. Restart your system
3. You may need to install Bluetooth drivers from your motherboard manufacturer's website

  guide](/docs/essential-setup/drivers/other/) for instructions.
</Callout>

## Diagnostics and troubleshooting

**When to use:** Enable if you need Windows built-in troubleshooting tools for diagnosing system issues.

Windows troubleshooting is disabled by default to prevent AtlasOS tweaks from being reset. However, if you encounter issues and need Windows' diagnostic tools, you can re-enable this feature.

To enable it, run the <CodeInline text="Enable Troubleshooting.cmd" /> file in the **Diagnostics and Troubleshooting** folder and restart.

<Callout type="warning">
  Enabling troubleshooting may reset some AtlasOS optimizations. Only enable if you specifically
  need Windows troubleshooting tools.
</Callout>

## Driver updates

**When to use:** Switch between automatic and manual driver installation based on your preference.

When installing AtlasOS, you choose between Automatic Driver Installation (via Windows Update) or Manual Driver Installation. You can change this choice later if needed.

To switch methods:

1. Open the **Driver Updates** folder in the Atlas folder
2. Run the appropriate file for your desired method
3. Restart your system

**Automatic:** Windows Update handles all driver installations automatically.
**Manual:** You install drivers yourself for full control over versions.

## FSO and Game Bar

**When to use:** Enable Game Bar if you want to record gameplay, take screenshots, or monitor performance. Disable FSO if you prefer fullscreen exclusive mode.

Game Bar is a Windows feature for screen recording, screenshots, and performance monitoring. It relies on Fullscreen Optimizations (FSO), which AtlasOS enables by default.

### Enable Game Bar

Game Bar is removed from AtlasOS by default. To enable it:

1. Run <CodeInline text="Enable FSO & Game Bar.reg" />
2. Install Game Bar from the [Microsoft Store](ms-windows-store://review/?ProductId=9NZKPSTSNW4P)

### Disable FSO (Fullscreen Exclusive Mode)

If you prefer fullscreen exclusive mode (better for some games with frame limiting), disable FSO:

1. Run <CodeInline text="Disable FSO & Game Bar.reg" />
2. This fixes compatibility with the "Disable fullscreen optimizations" option in game compatibility settings

<Callout type="info">
  Learn more about [Fullscreen
  Optimizations](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/directx/demystifying-full-screen-optimizations/) and
  [Fullscreen Exclusive](https://wiki.special-k.info/en/SwapChain) modes.
</Callout>

## Game mode

**When to use:** Enable if you want Windows to prioritize gaming performance, though results vary.

Game Mode is a Windows feature that prioritizes gaming performance by reducing background processes. However, research shows it may not always provide benefits and can sometimes reduce performance in certain games.

By default, Game Mode is disabled in AtlasOS. To enable it:

1. Run the <CodeInline text="Enable Game Mode.reg" /> file in the **Game Mode** folder
2. Restart your system

<Callout type="tip">
  Test Game Mode with your specific games to see if it helps. Many users find it unnecessary with
  AtlasOS optimizations.
</Callout>

## HAGS (Hardware-Accelerated GPU Scheduling)

**When to use:** Test if you want to improve GPU performance, but results vary by system.

HAGS is a Windows feature that can improve performance in GPU-intensive tasks by allowing the GPU to manage its memory more efficiently. However, it doesn't always produce positive results on every system.

To test HAGS:

1. Check if your GPU supports it (NVIDIA 10-series or newer, AMD RX 5000 series or newer)
2. Enable it in Windows Settings <IconArrow /> **System** <IconArrow /> **Display** <IconArrow /> **Graphics settings**
3. Restart your system
4. Test your applications to see if performance improves

<Callout type="info">
  HAGS is controlled through Windows Settings, not the Atlas folder. The impact varies by system and
  application, so testing is recommended.
</Callout>

## Lanman workstation (SMB)

**When to use:** Disable only if you don't need file sharing and don't use software that requires SMB (like AMD Ryzen Master).

SMB (Server Message Block) enables file sharing over a network. It's also required by some software like AMD Ryzen Master. AtlasOS enables it by default.

To disable SMB, run the <CodeInline text="Disable Lanman Workstation.cmd" /> file in the **Lanman Workstation (SMB)** folder and restart.

## Network discovery

**When to use:** Disable if you don't need to see or share with other computers on your network.

Network Discovery allows your computer to find and be found by other devices on your local network. AtlasOS enables it by default.

### Disable network discovery

To disable network discovery, run the <CodeInline text="Disable Network Discovery Services.cmd" /> file in the **Network Discovery** folder and restart.

### Enable file sharing

File sharing is disabled by default. To share files with other Windows devices on your network:

1. Run the <CodeInline text="Enable File Sharing.cmd" /> file in the **File Sharing** folder
2. Restart your system

### Network navigation pane

Control whether the "Network" section appears in File Explorer. To enable it, run the <CodeInline text="User Network Navigation Pane choice.reg" /> file in the **Network Navigation Pane** folder and restart.

## Notifications

**When to use:** Disable if you find notifications distracting and want a cleaner experience.

Notifications are enabled by default in AtlasOS. If you prefer a distraction-free experience, you can disable them.

To disable notifications, run the <CodeInline text="Disable Notifications.cmd" /> file in the **Notifications** folder and restart.

## Power settings

Control power-related behavior that affects performance, responsiveness, and power consumption.

### CPU idle

**When to use:** Disable only if you need maximum responsiveness and have adequate cooling. Not recommended for laptops or systems left running unattended.

Disabling CPU idle prevents the CPU from entering power-saving states, which reduces jitter and improves responsiveness by keeping the CPU at C-State 0. However, this increases power consumption and heat.

**Warning:** Only disable CPU idle if:

- You have adequate cooling
- You don't leave your PC running unattended for long periods
- You're not using a laptop
- You're comfortable managing power consumption

To disable CPU idle, use the appropriate file in the **CPU Idle** folder.

### Hibernation

**When to use:** Enable if you want your system to save its state to disk when shutting down (useful for quick resume).

Hibernation saves your system's current state to disk, allowing you to resume exactly where you left off. It's disabled by default in AtlasOS due to potential stability issues.

To enable hibernation, run the <CodeInline text="Enable Hibernation.cmd" /> file in the **Hibernation** folder.

### Power saving

**When to use:** Adjust based on your priority—performance vs. power efficiency.

Control your system's power-saving behavior. These settings affect both the power scheme and related system behavior, impacting performance.

To modify power saving settings, use the registry files in the **Power Saving** folder.

### Timer resolution

**When to use:** Increase if you use multimedia applications or frame rate limiters that benefit from precise timing.

Increasing timer resolution improves precision for applications requiring consistent pacing, such as multimedia apps and frame rate limiters. This comes at the cost of increased power consumption.

Adjust timer resolution using the files in the **Timer Resolution** folder. Test to see if your applications benefit.

## Printing

**When to use:** Enable if you need to print documents.

Printing is disabled by default in AtlasOS to improve system responsiveness. Enable it if you use printers.

To enable printing, run the <CodeInline text="Enable Printing.cmd" /> file in the **Printing** folder and restart.

## Search indexing

**When to use:** Enable if you frequently search for files and want faster search results.

Search Indexing speeds up file searches by indexing your files in the background. It's disabled by default to reduce system overhead.

To enable search indexing, run the <CodeInline text="Enable Search Indexing.cmd" /> file in the **Search Indexing** folder and restart.

<Callout type="tip">
  Search indexing uses system resources. Only enable if you frequently search for files and need
  faster results.
</Callout>

## Start menu

**When to use:** Install Open-Shell if you prefer a classic Start menu experience.

Customize your Start menu experience with Open-Shell, a tool that provides a customizable classic Start menu.

### Install Open-Shell

1. Run the <CodeInline text="Install Open-Shell.cmd" /> file
2. Follow the installation prompts
3. Optionally use the <CodeInline text="Atlas Open-Shell Preset.xml" /> file for a pre-configured setup

Learn more about [Open-Shell](https://github.com/Open-Shell/Open-Shell-Menu) and customize it to your preferences.

## System restore

**When to use:** Disable only if you don't need the ability to restore your system to a previous state and want to save disk space.

System Restore creates snapshots of your system that you can use to revert to a previous state. It's enabled by default but uses disk space.

To disable System Restore, run <CodeInline text="Disable System Restore.reg" /> in the **System Restore** folder and restart.

<Callout type="warning">
  Disabling System Restore removes the ability to roll back system changes. Only disable if you're
  confident you won't need this feature.
</Callout>

## VPN

**When to use:** Disable only if you don't use VPN software and want to reduce system overhead.

VPN support is enabled by default in AtlasOS for compatibility with VPN applications. If you don't use VPN software, you can disable it.

To disable VPN support, run the <CodeInline text="Disable VPN support.cmd" /> file in the **VPN** folder.

## Visual effects

**When to use:** Enable if you prefer Windows' visual animations and effects over maximum performance.

Windows includes visual effects like animated menus, tooltips, and window transitions. These enhance appearance but can slightly reduce performance. AtlasOS disables them by default for better performance.

To restore Windows visual effects, run the <CodeInline text="Default Windows Visual Effects.cmd" /> file in the **Visual Effects** folder.
