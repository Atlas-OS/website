# Atlas folder configuration

The Atlas Folder is located at <CodeInline text="C:\Atlas" /> and contains configuration files and scripts that control your AtlasOS installation.

## Folder structure

```

│   └── Advanced.ini
├── Scripts\
│   └── CustomScripts.ps1
└── Logs\
```

## Configuration files

  settings.
</Callout>
