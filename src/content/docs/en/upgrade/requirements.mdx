# Before upgrading

Verify you meet all requirements before proceeding with the upgrade.

## Version requirements

- Your system must currently run **AtlasOS 0.4.x or newer**
- Users on **0.3.x** must perform a [fresh install](/docs/install/) instead

<Callout type="info" title="Not Sure?">
  If you're unsure about your current AtlasOS version, check the [FAQ guide](/docs/faq/general/) for
  instructions on checking your version.
</Callout>

## Required files

Ensure you have:

- <Icon name="tabler:check" class="text-primary mr-1 inline h-4 w-4" /> The latest **AME Beta**
  executable
- <Icon name="tabler:check" class="text-primary mr-1 inline h-4 w-4" /> The **new Atlas Playbook** (
  <CodeInline text=".apbx" />) for the version you want to upgrade to

## Backup important data

<Callout type="warning" title="Recommended">
  While upgrades preserve most settings, always back up important data before upgrading.
</Callout>

## What gets preserved

- All user files and apps
- Most AtlasOS tweaks and settings

## Known limitations

**Upgrading from 0.4.x <Icon name="tabler:arrow-right" class="inline h-4 w-4 mx-1" /> 0.5.x:**

The upgrade does not carry over Atlas Folder configuration (General Configuration, Interface Tweaks, etc.). You'll need to re-apply these settings after the upgrade.

This limitation does not apply when upgrading from 0.5.x to later versions.
