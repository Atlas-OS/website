# Upgrade process

Follow these steps to upgrade your AtlasOS installation to a newer version.

## Step 1: Download assets

1. Visit [atlasos.net](https://atlasos.net)
2. Click **Get started** <IconArrow /> **Already following the guide?**
3. Download the newest **Atlas Playbook** and **AME Beta**

## Step 2: Launch AME Beta

1. Extract both downloads to your desktop
2. Run <CodeInline text="AME Beta.exe" />
3. If SmartScreen warning: **More info** <IconArrow /> **Run anyway** (safe to ignore)
4. Click **Updates** <IconArrow /> Update AME Beta if available

## Step 3: Upgrade AtlasOS

1. Drag the downloaded <CodeInline text="Atlas Playbook.apbx" /> file into AME Beta
2. When prompted, select **Upgrade** rather than **Run again**
3. AME Beta will analyze your current installation and apply only the changes required for the new version
4. Follow on-screen instructions and wait until the process completes
5. Your PC will reboot automatically

<Callout type="info" title="How It Works">
  AME Beta compares your current installation with the new Playbook and only applies the necessary
  changes. This ensures a smooth upgrade process without reinstalling everything.
</Callout>

## After upgrade

### Re-apply Atlas Folder configuration

If upgrading from **0.4.x <IconArrow /> 0.5.x**, you'll need to re-apply your Atlas Folder configuration:

1. Navigate to <CodeInline text="C:\Atlas\Config" />
2. Review and re-apply your settings from [Atlas Configuration](/docs/atlas-configuration/)

<Callout type="tip">
  This limitation only applies to upgrades from 0.4.x. Upgrades from 0.5.x+ will preserve your
  configuration automatically.
</Callout>

## Troubleshooting

### AME Beta doesn't show upgrade option

- Verify you're on Atlas 0.4.x or newer using the [Checking Atlas Version](/docs/faq/general/) guide
- Ensure you're using the latest version of AME Beta

### Systems on 0.3.x

Systems on **0.3.x** cannot be upgraded in-place. Follow the [Installation guide](/docs/install/) for a clean reinstall instead.
