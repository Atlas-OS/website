# Upgrade guide

Upgrade your existing AtlasOS installation to a newer version without reinstalling. This process preserves your settings and installed applications while applying the latest AtlasOS optimizations.

<Callout type="tip" title="Quick Summary">
  If you're running AtlasOS **v0.4.x or later**, you can upgrade directly to a newer version (e.g.,
  v0.5.x) using AME Beta. Clean installs are not required but are still recommended.
</Callout>

## Requirements

Before upgrading, ensure:

- Your system currently runs **AtlasOS 0.4.x or newer**
  - Users on **0.3.x** must perform a fresh install instead
- You have the latest **AME Beta** executable
- You have the **new Atlas Playbook** (<CodeInline text=".apbx" />) for the version you want to upgrade to (e.g., <CodeInline text="Atlas Playbook 0.5.x" />)

<Callout type="warning" title="Version Check">
  If you're unsure about your current AtlasOS version, check the [FAQ guide](/docs/faq/general/) for
  instructions on checking your version.
