# Installation FAQ

Common questions and troubleshooting for AtlasOS installation.

## Prerequisites

### What do I need to install AtlasOS?

- Windows 11 license (Pro, Pro for Workstations, or Enterprise)
- 64-bit CPU (x64) or ARM CPU (ARM64) - Use x64 Windows ISO for Intel/AMD CPUs, or ARM64 Windows ISO for ARM systems
- USB drive (only if installing from USB)
- Backup of important data

### Can I install on a virtual machine?

Yes, but some optimizations may not apply. Use the Playbook installation method.

### Which Windows editions are supported?

- Windows Pro
- Windows Pro for Workstations
- Windows Enterprise (excluding LTSC, IoT LTSC)

<Callout type="info">
  Windows Home is not supported. You can upgrade to Pro later by changing your product key.
</Callout>

## Installation process

### How long does installation take?

About 30-45 minutes, depending on your hardware and internet speed.

### What if I get a BitLocker error?

If you see "Make sure BitLocker Drive Encryption is suspended":

1. Boot back into your original Windows
2. **Control Panel** <Icon name="tabler:arrow-right" class="inline h-4 w-4 mx-1" /> **BitLocker Drive Encryption**
3. Click **Suspend protection** for your system drive
4. Restart and continue installation

<Callout type="tip">
  The drive stays encrypted; you can resume BitLocker after installation.
</Callout>

### What if Windows Update fails?

1. Check your internet connection
2. Run Windows Update Troubleshooter (**Settings** <Icon name="tabler:arrow-right" class="inline h-4 w-4 mx-1" /> **Update & Security** <Icon name="tabler:arrow-right" class="inline h-4 w-4 mx-1" /> **Troubleshoot**)
3. Restart and try again

### Why disconnect internet during Windows installation?

Prevents Windows from auto-installing drivers and updates, giving you more control over the process.

### What if installation fails?

Common causes:

- Not enough disk space (need at least 64GB free)
- Corrupted ISO file (re-download)
- BitLocker enabled (suspend it first)
- Hardware incompatibility (check Windows 11 requirements)

## Post-installation

### How do I remove Windows.old?

1. **Settings** <Icon name="tabler:arrow-right" class="inline h-4 w-4 mx-1" /> **System** <Icon name="tabler:arrow-right" class="inline h-4 w-4 mx-1" /> **Storage**
2. Click **Temporary files**
3. Select **Previous version of Windows** <Icon name="tabler:arrow-right" class="inline h-4 w-4 mx-1" /> **Remove files**

<Callout type="tip">
  This frees up significant disk space after you've retrieved any needed data.
</Callout>

### What should I do after installation?

After installation, follow these guides:

- [Essential Setup](/docs/essential-setup/) - Install drivers and optimize hardware
- [Atlas Configuration](/docs/atlas-configuration/) - Configure Atlas Folder settings
