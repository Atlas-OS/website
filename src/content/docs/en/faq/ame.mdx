# AME Beta FAQ

Common questions about AME Beta and troubleshooting installation issues.

## What is AME Beta?

AME Beta is the tool used to install and upgrade AtlasOS. It applies the Atlas Playbook to your Windows installation.

## AME Beta deleted or closed suddenly

If AME Beta suddenly closes or gets deleted, especially when a new version is released:

1. Add AME Beta as an exclusion in Windows Security
2. Or temporarily disable Real-time protection in Windows Security

  This is a false positive from Windows Defender. AME Beta is safe to use.

## Why is AME Beta being flagged?

AME Beta may be flagged by Windows Defender because it modifies system files. This is expected behavior for a tool that applies system optimizations.
