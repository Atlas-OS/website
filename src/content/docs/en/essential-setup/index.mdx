# Essential setup

Welcome! After installing AtlasOS, complete these essential setup steps to ensure your hardware works properly and your system performs at its best.

## What you chose during installation

During installation, you chose how drivers should be installed. Follow the path below based on your choice:

### If you chose Windows Update (automatic)

Drivers are being installed automatically via Windows Update. Verify everything is up to date:

1. Open **Settings** <IconArrow /> **Windows Update**
2. Click **Check for updates**
3. Install all available updates, including optional updates (especially driver updates)
4. Restart if prompted, then check for updates again until no more are available

<Callout type="tip">
  If your internet is working and your display is functioning, Windows Update likely installed your
  drivers automatically. You can skip the drivers section and proceed to hardware optimization
  (optional).
</Callout>

**Next:** Skip drivers and proceed to [Hardware Optimization](/docs/essential-setup/hardware/) (optional)

### If you chose manual installation

You'll need to install drivers yourself for full control over versions.

**Next:** Follow the [Drivers Guide](/docs/essential-setup/drivers/) to install all essential drivers, then proceed to hardware optimization (optional)
