# Graphics drivers

Install the latest graphics drivers for optimal performance and compatibility. This is the most important driver to install first, as it enables display output and gaming performance. This guide covers NVIDIA, AMD, and Intel graphics drivers.

<Callout type="warning" title="Multiple Graphics Cards">
  If you have integrated and dedicated graphics, you must install both drivers. For example, if you
  have an Intel CPU with integrated graphics and an NVIDIA GPU, install both Intel and NVIDIA
  drivers.
</Callout>

## Quick check

First, check if Windows Update has already installed your graphics drivers:

1. Open **Settings** <IconArrow /> **Windows Update**
2. Click **Check for updates**
3. Install any available optional updates

<Callout type="tip">
  Windows Update often installs basic graphics drivers automatically. For best performance, install
  manufacturer-specific drivers afterward.
</Callout>

## NVIDIA drivers

We recommend using NVCleanstall, as it is a GUI alternative to manually stripping drivers.

### Installation steps

1. **Download NVCleanstall**
   - Visit [TechPowerUp NVCleanstall](https://www.techpowerup.com/download/techpowerup-nvcleanstall)
   - Download and open the application, then click **Next**

<Callout type="info" title="Slow Download?">
  If the download is unusually slow or stuck, go to [NVIDIA's advanced driver
  search](https://www.nvidia.com/download/find.aspx) and download the latest Game Ready Driver after
  selecting your hardware and operating system. Launch NVCleanstall, choose **Use driver files on
  disk** and locate the previously downloaded driver.
</Callout>

2. **Select components**
   - **For Desktops:** Make sure that only **Display Driver** is checked and click **Next**
   - **For Laptops:** Check **Display Driver** and **Optimus** and click **Next** (More info on [NVIDIA's Website](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/technologies/optimus))

3. **Configure installation**
   After the driver is downloaded, tick the following:
   - Disable Installer Telemetry & Advertising
   - Perform a Clean Installation

- Output dynamic range - Full
- Output color depth - Value matching your monitor specification

**Optional:** Increase **Digital vibrance** in Display <IconArrow /> Adjust desktop color settings for better color saturation. For an alternative way to adjust digital vibrance, check out [VibranceGUI](https://vibrancegui.com).

### Force P-State 0 (advanced)

<Callout type="danger" title="Warning">
  This will force P-State 0 on your NVIDIA card **AT ALL TIMES**, making it always run at full
  power. It is not recommended if you leave your computer idle for long periods, have poor cooling,
  or use a laptop.
</Callout>

Run the following command in CMD as administrator:

```bat
for /f "tokens=*" %a in ('reg query "HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Class\{4d36e968-e325-11ce-bfc1-08002be10318}" /t REG_SZ /s /e /f "NVIDIA" ^| findstr "HK"') do (reg add "%a" /v "DisableDynamicPstate" /t REG_DWORD /d "1" /f)
```

After running this command, download and extract [NVIDIA Profile Inspector](https://github.com/Orbmu2k/nvidiaProfileInspector). Open the tool, scroll down to **5 - Common** section and set **CUDA - Force P2 State** to OFF. Press **Apply changes** and restart your device.

## AMD drivers

We recommend using RadeonSoftwareSlimmer, as it is an open-source GUI app alternative to manually stripping drivers.

### Installation steps

1. **Download Drivers**
   - Download the latest WHQL recommended driver from the [AMD Drivers and Support page](https://www.amd.com/en/support)
   - Download [RadeonSoftwareSlimmer](https://github.com/GSDragoon/RadeonSoftwareSlimmer) with the name of <CodeInline text="RadeonSoftwareSlimmer_XXX_net48.zip" />

2. **Configure installation**
   - Open the application and go to the **Pre-Install** tab
   - Select your installer file by clicking **Browse** and then confirm by double-clicking **Next**
   - After the extraction process, untick everything in the **Packages** tab apart from:
     - AMD Display Driver
     - AMD Settings (Required for Radeon Software)
     - These settings might be required for monitor sound:
       - AMD Audio CoProcessor Bus Driver
       - AMD Audio filter driver
       - AMD HDMI Audio driver
       - AMD High-Definition Audio Controller
       - AMD Streaming Audio Filter Driver

3. **Finalize installation**
   - Untick everything in the **Scheduled Tasks** tab
   - Untick everything in the **Display Driver Components**. If you are using Audio from your monitor, do not remove **High Definition Audio Bus**
   - Click **Modify Installer** and **Run Installer**, then continue with driver setup as usual

### Radeon Software configuration

1. Open Radeon Software by right-clicking on the desktop
2. Accept the terms and click the Settings icon in the top-right

   ```
5. Disable the residual AMD services and drivers. Typically the **AMD Crash Defender** and **AMD External Events Utility** (required for VRR) services.

### Disable Multi-Plane Overlay (MPO)

Disabling Multi-plane Overlay (MPO) can fix some desktop applications flickering or stuttering, which may occur during video playback using hardware acceleration with browsers.

MPO can be disabled by running the following command in CMD (run as administrator):

```bat
reg add "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\Dwm" /v "OverlayTestMode" /t REG_DWORD /d "5" /f
```

### Force P-State 0 (advanced)

_Documentation for this is not yet written. Feel free to contribute at [GitHub](https://github.com/Atlas-OS/docs)._

## Intel graphics

We recommend installing Intel graphics drivers from one of the following:

1. **Official Intel Website**
   - Visit the [official Intel website](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000005629/graphics/processor-graphics.html)

2. **Device/Motherboard Support Page**
   - **Recommended search query:** <CodeInline text="manufacturer" /> + <CodeInline text="model" /> + driver
   - **Example:** MSI B450-A PRO driver

3. **Snappy Driver Installer Origin (SDIO)**
   - Visit [SDIO website](https://www.glenn.delahoy.com/snappy-driver-installer-origin)

## Troubleshooting

### Driver installation fails

- **Disable antivirus temporarily** - Some antivirus software blocks driver installations
- **Run installer as administrator** - Right-click installer <IconArrow /> **Run as administrator**
- **Clean previous drivers** - Use [DDU (Display Driver Uninstaller)](https://www.guru3d.com/files-details/display-driver-uninstaller-download.html) for NVIDIA/AMD

### Games not performing well

- **Update to latest drivers** - Newer drivers often include game optimizations
- **Check GPU power settings** - Ensure GPU is set to maximum performance
- **Verify GPU is being used** - Some systems use integrated graphics instead of dedicated GPU

### Multiple GPUs

If you have both integrated and dedicated graphics:

1. Install drivers for both GPUs
2. Configure in BIOS/UEFI to use dedicated GPU for gaming
3. Set preferred GPU in Windows graphics settings

## Best practices

- **Download from official sources only** - Avoid third-party driver websites
- **Keep drivers updated** - Check for updates monthly or when experiencing issues
- **Use manufacturer utilities** - NVIDIA GeForce Experience and AMD Adrenalin help manage drivers
- **Don't install beta drivers** unless you need specific features - stick to stable releases

## Next steps

After installing graphics drivers:

1. **[Install chipset drivers](/docs/essential-setup/drivers/chipset/)** - Important for system stability
2. **[Install other drivers](/docs/essential-setup/drivers/other/)** - Bluetooth, printers, etc. if needed
3. **[Optimize hardware](/docs/essential-setup/hardware/)** (optional) - Enable XMP/DOCP and Resizable BAR for better performance
