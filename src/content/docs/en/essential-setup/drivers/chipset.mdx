# Chipset drivers

Chipset drivers are important for system stability and performance. They help your CPU communicate efficiently with other components like RAM, storage, and USB devices. Installing chipset drivers is especially recommended if you're not getting the expected performance or if you have a newer CPU generation.

## Finding your motherboard model

1. Download [HWiNFO](https://www.hwinfo.com/)
2. Open the application and click **Start** to view your motherboard model and other system information

## Installing from manufacturer website

We recommend downloading chipset drivers from your motherboard manufacturer's support page, as these are tested for your specific motherboard model.

1. Search for "_your motherboard model_ support" to find the manufacturer's support page
2. Find and download the chipset driver
3. Run the installer and follow the setup instructions
