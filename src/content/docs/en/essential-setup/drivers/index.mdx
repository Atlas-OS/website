# Drivers guide

Get your hardware working properly by installing the necessary drivers. Since you chose manual driver installation during setup, this guide will walk you through installing all essential drivers.

## Why manual installation?

You chose manual installation for:

- **Full control** over driver versions
- **Potentially lower system resource usage**
- **Fewer potentially unwanted applications**

If you'd prefer to switch to automatic installation via Windows Update, you can do so using the files in the <CodeInline text="2. Drivers" /> directory in the Atlas folder. See [our FAQ](/docs/faq/general/) if you can't find the Atlas folder.

<Callout type="info" title="Want to Switch to Automatic?">
  You can switch to automatic driver installation using the files in the{' '}
  <CodeInline text="2. Drivers" /> directory in the Atlas folder. This will allow Windows Update to
  handle driver installation automatically.
</Callout>

## Which drivers do I need?

Start with the essential drivers your system needs to function properly:

- **Graphics (GPU/iGPU)** - Required for display output and gaming performance
- **Audio** - For sound output from speakers or headphones
- **Wi-Fi/Network** - Required for internet connectivity
- **Bluetooth** - For wireless peripherals (only if you use Bluetooth devices)
- **Chipset** - Important for system stability and performance

<Callout type="warning" title="Multiple Graphics Cards">
  If you have both integrated and dedicated graphics (e.g., Intel CPU with NVIDIA GPU), you must
  install drivers for both. This ensures proper functionality and allows you to switch between GPUs
  as needed.
</Callout>

<Callout type="tip">
  Install drivers in this order: Graphics → Network → Audio → Chipset → Other (Bluetooth, etc.).
  This ensures your display and internet work first, then other functionality.

## Next steps

After installing all necessary drivers:

- **[Optimize hardware](/docs/essential-setup/hardware/)** (optional) - Enable XMP/DOCP and Resizable BAR for better performance
- **Configure [Atlas settings](/docs/atlas-configuration/)** to customize your installation
- **Explore [optional tweaks](/docs/atlas-configuration/tweaks/)** to personalize your experience
