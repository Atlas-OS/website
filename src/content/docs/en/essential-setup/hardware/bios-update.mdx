# BIOS update

Keeping your BIOS up to date is important for compatibility, performance, and security. This should be done first before enabling other hardware optimizations like XMP/DOCP and Resizable BAR, as BIOS updates can reset these settings.

<Callout type="warning" title="Important Warning">
  Incorrect BIOS updates can permanently damage your motherboard. Only update if necessary, follow
  manufacturer instructions exactly, and never interrupt the update process.
</Callout>

## Before you begin

### Check current BIOS version

1. Press <CodeInline text="Win + R" />
2. Type <CodeInline text="msinfo32" /> and press <CodeInline text="Enter" />
3. Look for **BIOS Version/Date** in the System Information window

### Identify your motherboard

You need to know your exact motherboard model:

- **Check System Information** (as above) - Look for **BaseBoard Manufacturer** and **BaseBoard Product**
- **Check physical motherboard** - Model number is usually printed on the board
- **Use system detection tools** - Many manufacturer websites have auto-detection tools

## Update process

### Step 1: Download BIOS update

1. Visit your motherboard manufacturer's support website:
   - **ASUS**: [asus.com/support](https://www.asus.com/support/)
   - **MSI**: [msi.com/support](https://www.msi.com/support/)
   - **Gigabyte**: [gigabyte.com/support](https://www.gigabyte.com/support/)
   - **ASRock**: [asrock.com/support](https://www.asrock.com/support/)
2. Enter your motherboard model
3. Go to **Downloads** or **BIOS** section
4. Download the latest BIOS file (usually a <CodeInline text=".zip" /> or <CodeInline text=".exe" /> file)

<Callout type="info">
  Read the BIOS update notes/changelog - only update if the new version fixes issues you're
  experiencing or adds features you need.
</Callout>

### Step 2: Prepare for update

1. **Backup current BIOS** - Some manufacturers provide backup tools
2. **Ensure stable power** - Use a UPS if possible, or ensure laptop is fully charged and plugged in
3. **Close all applications** - Close unnecessary programs
4. **Disable antivirus temporarily** - May interfere with BIOS update

### Step 3: Update BIOS

**Method 1: Windows-based update (easiest)**

Many manufacturers provide Windows utilities:

1. Extract the downloaded BIOS file
2. Run the BIOS update utility (e.g., <CodeInline text="Setup.exe" /> or manufacturer-specific tool)
3. Follow on-screen instructions
4. **Do not power off or restart** during the update
5. System will restart automatically when complete

**Method 2: BIOS flash utility**

1. Extract the BIOS file to a USB drive (FAT32 formatted)
2. Restart and enter BIOS/UEFI (usually <CodeInline text="Del" /> or <CodeInline text="F2" /> during boot)
3. Use the BIOS flash utility (varies by manufacturer)
4. Select the BIOS file from USB
5. Start the update process
6. **Do not power off or restart** during the update

<Callout type="danger" title="Critical Warning">
  **NEVER** interrupt a BIOS update. The system will restart automatically when complete.
  Interrupting can brick your motherboard.
</Callout>

## After update

1. BIOS will restart automatically
2. Enter BIOS/UEFI and verify the new version
3. Load optimized defaults or reconfigure settings
4. Save and exit
5. Boot into Windows and verify everything works

## Troubleshooting

### Update failed

If the update process was interrupted:

- **Try recovery methods** - Many motherboards have BIOS recovery features
- **Contact manufacturer support** - They may provide recovery instructions
- **Professional repair** - May be required if recovery fails

### System won't boot after update

1. **Clear CMOS** - Remove CMOS battery or use jumper (check manual)
2. **Reset BIOS settings** - Load default/optimized settings
3. **Check all connections** - Ensure RAM, CPU, power cables are secure

## Best practices

- **Only update if necessary** - Don't update just because a new version exists
- **Read release notes** - Understand what the update fixes or adds
- **Use stable power** - Ensure uninterrupted power supply
- **Follow manufacturer instructions** - Each manufacturer has specific procedures
- **Keep a backup** - Some tools let you backup current BIOS before updating

## Next steps

After updating your BIOS:

- **[Enable XMP/DOCP](/docs/essential-setup/hardware/memory/)** - Unlock your RAM's full speed
- **[Enable Resizable BAR](/docs/essential-setup/hardware/gpu/)** - Improve GPU performance if you have a compatible graphics card
- **Configure [Atlas settings](/docs/atlas-configuration/)** to customize your installation
